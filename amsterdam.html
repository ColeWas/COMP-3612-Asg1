                <p>The only floating flower market in the world; Amsterdam’s Flower Market is a renowned icon on the Singel canal, at the heart of the city’s UNESCO-listed Canal Ring. The market here actually dates from 1862, when flower growers would sail their wares on barges into the city centre via the Amstel River.</p>
